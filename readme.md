Asura Token
## Description
The Halcon Token is an ERC20-compatible token implemented in Solidity. It provides basic functionalities such as minting, burning, and transferring tokens. This README serves as a guide to understand the purpose, functionality, and usage of the Halcon Token contract.

## Getting Started
Prerequisites
To interact with the Halcon Token contract, you need:

An Ethereum wallet (such as MetaMask) connected to the Ethereum mainnet or testnet.
An Ethereum development environment (such as Remix, Truffle, or Hardhat) for compiling and deploying contracts.

## Deployment
To deploy the Halcon Token contract:

Copy the contract code from Halcon.sol.
Deploy the contract using your preferred Ethereum development environment.
Provide the necessary parameters (name, symbol, initial supply) during contract deployment.
After deployment, the contract owner can mint additional tokens, change the token name or symbol, and perform other administrative tasks as needed.

## Functionality
Minting Tokens
- Only the contract owner can mint new tokens using the mint function.
- Tokens can be minted and assigned to any address specified by the owner.
Burning Tokens
- Any user can burn their own tokens using the burn function.
- This function allows users to reduce their token balance by destroying tokens.
Transferring Tokens
The Halcon Token contract inherits the standard ERC20 functionality, allowing any user to transfer tokens to other addresses.
